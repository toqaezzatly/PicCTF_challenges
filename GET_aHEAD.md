# GET aHEAD - PicoCTF

## Lesson Learned
As the name suggests, we should **GET aHEAD**, aka **GET a header**, meaning we need to send a `HEAD` request instead of `POST`.

### How to Do It:
1. Click on **Use BurpSuite** or any other tool.
2. Check the request details.

3. **Modify the request header**:
   - Change **`POST /index.php HTTP/1.1`** â†’ **`HEAD /index.php HTTP/1.1`**.

### The Flag:
```
picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_775f2530}
```

## Alternative Approach:
You can use **`curl`** to send a HEAD request:
```bash
curl -I <url>
```
This method will retrieve only the header, which contains the flag.
