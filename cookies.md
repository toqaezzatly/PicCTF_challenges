# Cookies - PicoCTF 🍪

Honestly, I'm not entirely sure what the main lesson from this challenge is, but here are the steps I followed:

### Steps to Solve the Challenge:
1. Rewrite the placeholder `snickerdoodle` since there was nothing else to start with.
2. Open **Developer Tools** (`F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`).
3. Navigate to the **Cookies** section.
4. Increase the value of the cookies to `18`.
5. And here it is—the flag!
