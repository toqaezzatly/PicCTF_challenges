Okay, this is one of the **strangest challenges** I've come across.

Trying to be smart about it actually sent me down a very frustrating path. I started off thinking it might be something deep like **logic circuits**—ended up miles away. Then I thought, "Okay maybe it's some **reverse engineering** thing," and yeah... still overcomplicating it.

But in the end, it was way simpler than all that.

In the following pic, I found the flag just by **messing around** 👇

And it happened **again** with the same connectivity 🤷‍♂️

I knew someone who just **kept sending the same request** to the server until the response had the flag.

So I tried the same… and it worked 😅

Check this out 👇

✅ Flag:

❌ Wrong Answer:

This happened because the **input values change randomly**—so even if your connectivity setup is the same, you **might get a flag** one time and **not** the next.

### 💡 Lesson Learned:
Sometimes being too smart can be your downfall in CTFs.  
Not everything is deep logic or reverse engineering.  
**Trial, error, and a little bit of chaos** can go a long way.  
Also—**randomness matters**. If you're getting inconsistent outputs, **don't rule out retrying** the same input!
